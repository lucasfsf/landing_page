        <blockquote>
            Once upon a time, there was only darkness, and there were monsters vast as stars who swam in it. They were the Bamboo Stalks, and they loved the darkness because it concealed their uglyness. Whenever some other creature contrived to make light, they would extinguish it. When stars were born, they swallowed them, and it seemed that darkness would be eternal.
